# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

The data is in the file GSScsv.csv and came from the 2018 General Social Survey.  The question to answer is to resolve this hypothesis.  
$H_0$ There is no difference between the average score on the WORDSUM test and level of schooling DEGREE  
$H_a$ There is a significant difference in average score on the WORDSUM test between at least two levels of DEGREE  

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
boxplot(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=GSSdata)
```
 
```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(GSSdata,aes(x=DEGREE,y=WORDSUM))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
  

  

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->
  
  
```{r}  
favstats(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=GSSdata)
```

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->


# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
